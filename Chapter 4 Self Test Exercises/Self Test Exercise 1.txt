1.  When a function with a a call-by-value parameter is invoked, what happens is that 
    the value of the argument is passed to the parameter and it acts as a local variable.
    The value of the variable that is passed as an argument does not change.

2.  Yes, the following function will perform correctly. This because since the argument is 
    pass by value, only the values will be used to calculate in the function.

3.  1 20 3

4.  Only the value of variable 2 would change to be the value of variable 1.
    So in essence, these two variables would be the same value;

5.  void zeroBoth(int& number1, int& number2){
        number1 = 0;
        number2 = 0;
    }

6.  void addTax(double taxRate, double& cost){
        taxRate/=100;
        cost = taxRate*cost+cost;
    }

7.  If the formal parameters were changed to call by value parameters, the value of n1 and n2 would not change.

8.  The function that would be used is "int score(double points)";

9.  The first "theAnswer" would be used because it has 2 double parameters.
